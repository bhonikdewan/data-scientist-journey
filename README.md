# Hi, I'm Bhomik Dewan 👋

I’m an MCA graduate (2024, Sikkim University) currently working as a **Sales Assistant in Bahrain**.  
I’m transitioning into **Data Science** because working with data genuinely fascinates me more than my current role.

---

## Background

- 🎓 MCA, Sikkim University (2024)
- 💼 Currently in retail sales (Bahrain)
- 🌍 Experience dealing with customers, numbers, targets, and daily business decisions

Due to personal and practical reasons, I took up a sales role after graduation. While the job helped me understand people and business realities, it also made me realize that **I enjoy analysis, logic, and problem-solving far more than routine sales work**.

---

## Why Data Science

I’ve always been curious about:
- Why some products sell better than others
- How patterns repeat in sales and customer behavior
- How decisions can be improved using data instead of assumptions

Data science feels like the right intersection of **logic, curiosity, and real-world impact**. I enjoy working with numbers, exploring patterns, and turning raw data into insights.

## What I Want to Solve

I’m interested in solving practical problems such as:
- Understanding customer behavior and preferences
- Extracting insights from sales and business data
- Identifying trends and patterns in real datasets
- Supporting better decision-making using data

I prefer **real-world, applied problems** over purely theoretical ones.

## What I’m Learning

- Python for data analysis
- Statistics & probability
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- SQL
- Machine learning fundamentals
- Working with real datasets

---

## Goal

To build strong, practical data skills and transition into a **data-focused role** by consistently learning, building projects, and improving through real-world problem solving.

## About This Repository

This repository will contain:
- Learning notes
- Practice notebooks
- Mini projects
- Applied data experiments

It represents my journey into data science—step by step.
